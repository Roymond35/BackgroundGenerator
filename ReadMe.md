# The Background Generator
----
This was a project I first started working on in April 2016. The idea behind it was that I wanted to make a library that created desktop/phone backgrounds. I always enjoyed the idea of procedurally generated art. I remember wanting to conquer it on my own without looking at external libraries or algorithms.

In the end, I adopted started making a GUI to allow my partner at the time to play around with it and to see what she could generate. It was my first dip into create an UI through swing and it was a rather interesting process. 

In 2017, I decided to try a different approach to generating backgrounds. For that repo, you can go [here](http://github.com/rgero/BackgroundGenerator)

In September 2019, I decided to revist the project and redesign the UI so that it made more sense.

## Here are some examples of the generated backgrounds
